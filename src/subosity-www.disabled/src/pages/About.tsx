            <p className="text-body-secondary">
              Subosity was born from a simple observation: managing multiple subscriptions
              had become increasingly complex in today's digital world. From streaming
              services to software licenses, from gym memberships to magazine subscriptions,
              keeping track of everything was a challenge.
            </p>
            <p className="text-body-secondary">
              We created Subosity to solve this problem, offering a unified platform where
              you can track, manage, and optimize all your subscriptions in one place.
              Our platform helps you avoid unexpected charges, manage renewal dates, and
              make informed decisions about your subscription spending.
