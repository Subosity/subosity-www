# Development Environment Variables
# Copy this file to .env.development to override the default production URLs for local development

# Uncomment and modify these lines to point to your local development servers:
# GATSBY_APP_URL=http://localhost:3000
# GATSBY_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8000

# Note: These environment variables will only be used if explicitly set.
# If not set, the application will default to production URLs:
# - https://app.subosity.com
# - https://subosity.com
